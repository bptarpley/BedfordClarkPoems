                    Note: On the 14th (some say the 13th) of January, 1903, a mysterious figure known as David E. George died of self-induced strychnine (some say arsenic) poisoning in Room 4 (some say 3) of the Grand Avenue Hotel in Enid, Oklahoma Territory. He had claimed to be John Wilkes Booth (some say he was).

                <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
                    First Friday Mass dismissed, my blessing gone<br />
                    With them into the brittle cold of dawn,<br />
                    The ladies of my “remnant” snugged along<br />
                    The stubbled field of maize toward Madison<br />
                    And home. <i>Old Mrs. Vater’s City niece,<br />
                    Her smile askew, had not received.</i> The cup<br />
                    And paten cleansed and set aside, I sent<br />
                    The Jarboe twins, pale Ralph and burly Fred,<br />
                    To breakfast quick on Mama’s mush and cream<br />
                    Before the tardy-bell’s stern summoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Fred was back: “Please, Father Gus, you’d best<br />
                    Come see this man. There’s something <i>wrong</i> with him!”<br />
                    His voice slipped out of pitch, betrayed real fear.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Half-vested still, I stepped out on the porch,<br />
                    And there he stood and worked a rattan cane<br />
                    Beneath his thumb compulsively . . . in dark<br />
                    Broadcloth alone against that chill without<br />
                    A flinch – black hair and eyes – charcoal mustache –<br />
                    The face too white – soft collar wide and rolled<br />
                    Like scribblers’ in a boulevard café. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He doffed and said, “Good morrow, Father,” bowed,<br />
                    And seemed to want a special word from me,<br />
                    Some cued response (recall how players on<br />
                    The stage will try to aid another when<br />
                    He’s lost his lines). 
                </p>
                <p class="big-indent">
                    I stood there dumb, but he,<br />
                    To move the scene, spoke like a biloquist<br />
                    (“Benedicite!”), smiled, and bowed again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You’re Catholic?”
                </p>
                <p class="big-indent">
                    “My Asia thought it so.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    His left hand took the cane, and with his snubbed<br />
                    Right thumb he gestured at the early sun:<br />
                    “What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light<br />
                    To grubs and eyeless skulls?” 
                </p>
                <p class="big-indent">
                    He never blinked,<br />
                    Not once. It wasn’t drink . . . perhaps morphine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<br />
                    By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I asked him who he was, and he glanced down:<br /> 
                    “A creature unprepared, unmeet for death . . .”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I said I’d hear his sins.
                </p>
                <p class="big-indent">
                    “Oh, by and by<br />
                    I’d have some speech with you.” He grinned much like<br />
                    A burlesque Irishman, then limped away.<br />
                    <i>I say he limped; which limb he favored was<br />
                    Obscure.</i>
                </p>
                <p class="big-indent">
                    I felt the cold, went in to tea<br />
                    And rolls I could not taste, reminded of<br />
                    A carrion bird I’d seen near Bruges decades<br />
                    Ago. Wings spread, it dropped off a low bough<br />
                    And waddled toward a newly stillborn calf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That noon I found the church unduly dim;<br />
                    The sanctuary lamp had guttered out.
