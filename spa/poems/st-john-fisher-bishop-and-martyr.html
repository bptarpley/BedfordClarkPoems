                <p>
                    <i>The head was off before the crimson hat<br />
                    Arrived</i> – Oh John, who fished for men, knaves say<br />
                    You knew how death leaned close and it was that<br />
                    That nerved your stout resolve to bark a nay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>The head was off</i> – but on the traitor’s pike<br />
                    Its grim and pinched façade grew ruddy young,<br />
                    Aflush with Cana-wine. The headsman’s strike<br />
                    Recalled another John – the dance and song<br />
                    Antipas called – so plain folk whispered loud<br />
                    Along the bridge and in the cauldron streets.<br />
                    Then Henry paused, but donned his purple shroud<br />
                    To churn again between infernal sheets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this late date, staunch John, Rochester’s Rock,<br />
                    Pray hard for shepherds who sell short the flock.<br />
                    Your Tudor peers feared fire, the rough-hewn block:<br />
                    They might have held against progressive talk.
